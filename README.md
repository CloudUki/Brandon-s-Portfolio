Hi I am Brandon Yang, a senior at Moravian University.
Here is a website that hosts my other projects that I have worked on. This is programmed with HTML(Bootstrap), SCSS and JavaScript. 


- To make the scss file automatically update the css file, run
```sh
sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css
```



Next plans:
-React App
